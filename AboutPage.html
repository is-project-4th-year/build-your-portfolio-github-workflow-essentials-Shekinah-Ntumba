                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm <strong>Shekinah Ntumba</strong>, a dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences. With a strong foundation in frontend development, I design sleek, responsive user interfaces that are both intuitive and visually engaging. On the backend, I build robust, scalable systems that integrate databases, RESTful APIs, and machine learning models to deliver intelligent and data-driven functionality.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, where I've developed solid skills in software engineering, data analysis, and cybersecurity. My academic background has been instrumental in shaping my problem-solving mindset and technical confidence—especially in areas like AI, systems design, and real-world application development.</p>
                               
                    <p>I enjoy working on real-world problems and have built systems ranging from predictive dashboards to educational platforms tailored to the African context. My development journey reflects a blend of curiosity, purpose, and continuous learning—especially in the areas of AI, data science, and secure application design.</p>
                
                    <p>Beyond the code, I value teamwork, innovation, and building solutions that make a difference. Whether it's optimizing a user experience or integrating advanced features, I strive to bring both creativity and technical depth to every project I touch.</p>
